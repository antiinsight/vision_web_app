# vision_web_app
Repository for VIZN web application

The source code is written in R using the Shiny Package to develop the GUI. The www folder contains css and html files needed for proper rendering of the web page.

If you clone this repository, the "Demo with sample data" function will not work unless you supply your own sample data in the "www" folder. Github does not allow files this large to be uploaded.
