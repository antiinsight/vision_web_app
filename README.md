# Preface
This was the first project I created after learning to code. It works, but it is not pretty. Good programming practices are not followed here in almost any capacity. So I apologize now for the horror that lives within this repo. Thanks!

# vision_web_app
Repository for VIZN web application. Functioning web application can be found at: https://anthony-scott.shinyapps.io/vision_web_app/

The source code is written in R using the Shiny Package to develop the GUI. The www folder contains css and html files needed for proper rendering of the web page.

<strike>If you clone this repository, the "Demo with sample data" function will not work unless you supply your own sample data in the "www" folder. Github does not allow files this large to be uploaded. Please feel free to contact me if you would like Sample Data supplied.</strike>

SampleData is now included in the Repo!
