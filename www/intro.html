	     <p class="maintext">VIZN is a web-based tool to completely automate the processing of raw data files produced by the Zebrabox/Zebralab motion capture software. Raw data spreadsheets should be uploaded directly as produced and should not be modified in any way before upload. The VIZN software assumes the Zebrabox protocol was performed in such a way that the 5, 1-second periods of darkness initiate at time points (in seconds): 1800, 1830, 1860, 1890, and 1920. This must be true for analysis to be performed successfully. A step-wise process for using this software is below.</p>

	     <p class="maintext"><h4>Step 1 (Upload)</h4> - Select <b>Demo with Sample Data</b> or Select <b>Choose File</b> and upload the raw data spreadsheet. The sample data represents a real raw data output from a zebrabox run. <br><br>
<h4>Step 2 (Activity Plot)</h4> - Go to the <b>Activity Plot</b> tab and use the <b>Row Selection</b> to select a row of control fish. You should see 5 distinct peaks corresponding to the startle responses. If you had a highly active group of fish and your data is noisy you can adjust the <b>Response Threshold</b> to raise the detection level above the noise but still keep them below the maximum of the peaks.<br><br>
<h4>Step 3 (Startle Responses)</h4> - Go to the <b>Startle Responses</b> tab. This will provide a graph of the average number of visual startle responses by row. Use the Group selection boxes to select rows of similar genotype/treatment and then check the <b>Group Rows</b> box at the bottom. This will produce a graph of the groupings as well as provide a table with statistics comparing between the groups.<br><br>
<h4>Step 4 (Results Table)</h4> - On the <b>Results Table</b> tab you will be provided a table representing # of startle responses for every well on the 96 well plate. A Value of NA indicates that well was empty (or the fish didnâ€™t move during the entire 32.5 minutes of the experiment). This table can be downloaded as a .csv file.
